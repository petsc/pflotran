abstract = "Abstract Since the first reported discovery of the Lost City 
hydrothermal system in 2001, it was recognized that seawater alteration of 
ultramafic rocks plays a key role in the composition of the coexisting vent 
fluids. The unusually high pH and high concentrations of \{H2\} and \{CH4\} 
provide compelling evidence for this. Here we report the chemistry of 
hydrothermal fluids sampled from two vent structures (Beehive: ~90-116 C, and 
M6: ~75 °C) at Lost City in 2008 during cruise \{KNOX18RR\} using \{ROV\} 
Jason 2 and R/V Revelle assets. The vent fluid chemistry at both sites reveals 
considerable overlap in concentrations of dissolved gases (H2, CH4), trace 
elements (Cs, Rb, Li, B and Sr), and major elements (SO4, Ca, K, Na, Cl), 
including a surprising decrease in dissolved Cl, suggesting a common source 
fluid is feeding both sites. The absence of Mg and relatively high 
concentrations of Ca and sulfate suggest solubility control by 
serpentine-diopside-anhydrite, while trace alkali concentrations, especially 
Rb and Cs, are high, assuming a depleted mantle protolith. In both cases, but 
especially for Beehive vent fluid, the silica concentrations are well in 
excess of those expected for peridotite alteration and the coexistence of 
serpentine-brucite at all reasonable temperatures. However, both the measured 
pH and silica values are in better agreement with 
serpentine-diopside-tremolite-equilibria. Geochemical modeling demonstrates 
that reaction of plagioclase with serpentinized peridotite can shift the 
chemical system away from brucite and into the tremolite stability field. This 
is consistent with the complex intermingling of peridotite and gabbroic bodies 
commonly observed within the Atlantis Massif. We speculate the existence of 
such plagioclase bearing peridotite may also account for the highly enriched 
trace alkali (Cs, Rb) concentrations in the Lost City vent fluids. 
Additionally, reactive transport modeling taking explicit account of 
temperature dependent rates of mineral dissolution and precipitation clarifies 
the feedback between permeability, heat loss, and changes in the dissolved Si 
of the vent fluids. Assuming both the Beehive and \{M6\} vent fluids were 
sourced at similar subseafloor conditions (tremolite buffered at 200 C), model 
results indicate loss of approximately 30\% Si upon cooling to ~150 C during 
upflow. However, Si concentrations remained largely conservative with 
continued cooling to lower temperatures owing to unfavorable reaction 
kinetics. While consistent with the Beehive endmember composition, these 
results fail to explain the relative Si depletion in the lower temperature 
\{M6\} fluids. Thus, it may be that more robust kinetic models for silicates 
are needed to accurately account for the mechanism and rate of silica removal 
in the unusually high pH of the Lost City vent fluids. "

abstract = "To investigate \{CO2\} Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) in 
sandstones, we performed three 150C flow-through experiments on K-feldspar-rich
cores from the Eau Claire formation. By characterizing fluid and solid samples 
from these experiments using a suite of analytical techniques, we explored the 
coupled evolution of fluid chemistry, mineral reaction rates, and 
hydrogeochemical properties during \{CO2\} sequestration in feldspar-rich 
sandstone. Overall, our results confirm predictions that the heightened acidity 
resulting from supercritical \{CO2\} injection into feldspar-rich sandstone 
will dissolve primary feldspars and precipitate secondary aluminum minerals. A 
core through which CO2-rich deionized water was recycled for 52 days decreased 
in bulk permeability, exhibited generally low porosity associated with high 
surface area in post-experiment core sub-samples, and produced an Al hydroxide 
secondary mineral, such as boehmite. However, two samples subjected to ~3 day 
single-pass experiments run with CO2-rich, 0.94 mol/kg NaCl brines decreased in 
bulk permeability, showed generally elevated porosity associated with elevated 
surface area in post-experiment core sub-samples, and produced a phase with 
kaolinite-like stoichiometry. CO2-induced metal mobilization during the 
experiments was relatively minor and likely related to Ca mineral dissolution. 
Based on the relatively rapid approach to equilibrium, the relatively slow 
near-equilibrium reaction rates, and the minor magnitudes of permeability 
changes in these experiments, we conclude that \{CCUS\} systems with projected 
lifetimes of several decades are geochemically feasible in the feldspar-rich 
sandstone end-member examined here. Additionally, the observation that 
K-feldspar dissolution rates calculated from our whole-rock experiments are in 
good agreement with literature parameterizations suggests that the latter can 
be utilized to model \{CCUS\} in K-feldspar-rich sandstone. Finally, by 
performing a number of reactive transport modeling experiments to explore 
processes occurring during the flow-through experiments, we have found that 
the overall progress of feldspar hydrolysis is negligibly affected by quartz 
dissolution, but significantly impacted by the rates of secondary mineral 
precipitation and their effect on feldspar saturation state. The observations 
produced here are critical to the development of models of \{CCUS\} 
operations, yet more work, particularly in the quantification of coupled 
dissolution and precipitation processes, will be required in order to produce 
models that can accurately predict the behavior of these systems. "

   electromagnetic borehole flowmeter tests. A Bayesian data assimilation
   technique, the method of anchored distributions (MAD) (Rubin et al.,
   2010), was applied to assimilate the experimental tracer test data with
   the other types of data and to infer the three-dimensional heterogeneous
   structure of the hydraulic conductivity in the saturated zone of the
   Hanford formation. In this study, the Bayesian prior information on the
   underlying random hydraulic conductivity field was obtained from
   previous field characterization efforts using constant-rate injection
   and borehole flowmeter test data. The posterior distribution of the
   conductivity field was obtained by further conditioning the field on the
   temporal moments of tracer breakthrough curves at various observation
   wells. MAD was implemented with the massively parallel three-dimensional
   flow and transport code PFLOTRAN to cope with the highly transient flow
   boundary conditions at the site and to meet the computational demands of
   MAD. A synthetic study proved that the proposed method could effectively
   invert tracer test data to capture the essential spatial heterogeneity
   of the three-dimensional hydraulic conductivity field. Application of
   MAD to actual field tracer data at the Hanford 300 Area demonstrates
   that inverting for spatial heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity under
   transient flow conditions is challenging and more work is needed.}},

   times up to 100 yr, taking into account rapid fluctuations in the

   simulations are carried out to describe the migration of hexavalent
   uranium {[}U(VI)] at the Hanford 300 Area bordering the Columbia River
   and to better understand the persistence of the uranium plume at the
   site. The computer code PFLOTRAN developed under a DOE SciDAC-2 project
   is employed in the simulations that are executed on ORNL's Cray XT4/XT5
   supercomputer Jaguar. The conceptual model used in the simulations is
   based on the recognition of three distinct phases or time periods in the
   evolution of the U(VI) plume. These correspond to (1) initial waste
   emplacement; (2) initial presence of both labile and nonlabile U(VI)
   with an evolved U(VI) plume extending from the source region to the
   river boundary, representing present-day conditions; and (3) the
   complete removal of all nonlabile U(VI) and labile U(VI) in the vadose
   zone. This work focuses primarily on modeling Phase II using equilibrium
   and multirate sorption models for labile U(VI) and a continuous source
   release of nonlabile U(VI) in the South Process Pond through dissolution
   of metatorbernite as a surrogate mineral. For this case, rapid
   fluctuations in the Columbia River stage combined with the slow release
   of nonlabile U(VI) from contaminated sediment are found to play a
   predominant role in determining the migration behavior of U(VI) with
   sorption only a second-order effect. Nevertheless, a multirate model was
   essential in explaining breakthrough curves obtained from laboratory
   column experiments using the same sediment and is demonstrated to be
   important in Phase III. The calculations demonstrate that U(VI) is
   discharged to the river at a highly fluctuating rate in a ratchet-like
   behavior as the river stage rises and falls. The high-frequency
   fluctuations must be resolved in the model to calculate the flux of
   U(VI) at the river boundary. By time averaging the instantaneous flux to
   average out noise superimposed on the river stage fluctuations, the
   cumulative U(VI) flux to the river is found to increase approximately
   linearly with time. The flow rate and U(VI) flux are highly sensitive to
   the conductance boundary condition that describes the river-sediment
   interface. By adjusting the conductance coefficient to give a better
   match to the measured piezometric head, good agreement was obtained with
   field studies for both the mean flux of water of 10(9) kg/yr and U(VI)
   of 25 kg/yr at the river-aquifer boundary for a computational domain
   encompassing the South Process Pond. Finally, it is demonstrated that,
   through global mass conservation, the U(VI) leach rate from the source
   region is related to the U(VI) flux at the river boundary.}},

Abstract = {{We describe PFLOTRAN, a recently developed code for modeling
   multi-phase, multicomponent subsurface flow and reactive transport using
   massively parallel computers. PFLOTRAN is built on top of PETSc, the
   Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation. Leveraging
   PETSc has allowed us to develop-with a relatively modest investment in
   development effort-a code that exhibits excellent performance on the
   largest-scale supercomputers. Very significant enhancements to the code
   are planned during our SciDAC-2 project. Here we describe the current
   state of the code, present an example of its use on Jaguar, the Cray
   XT3/4 system at Oak Ridge National Laboratory consisting of H 706
   dual-core Opteron processor nodes, and briefly outline our future plans
   for the code.}},
