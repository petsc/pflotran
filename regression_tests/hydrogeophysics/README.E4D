Overview
This manuscript document the basic operation and usage of the E4D module 
for PFLOTRAN. Users should be familiar with both PFLOTRAN and mode 1 and 
mode 2 of E4D before attempting to use the E4D module. 

The E4D module for PFLOTRAN enables user to simulate a time-lapse sequence 
of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) surveys, given a time varying 
subsurface simulated by PFLOTRAN. In it's current implementation, E4D is 
allocated a dedicated set of process  that run in parallel with the PFLOTRAN
cores/processes. PFLOTRAN passess information to E4D through a single E4D 
master process, which communicates with and orchestrates operations among 
the E4D slave processes. At the completion of each time-step, PFLOTRAN 
informs E4D that a time-step has been completed. E4D then checks a user 
supplied database of survey times. If a survey time is specified for the 
current time step, then PFLOTRAN sends E4D the current state of the system.
In it's current implementation, that state includes saturation and tracer 
concentration only, but the basic framework is in place for users to modify
the code to pass E4D any state variables computed by PFLOTRAN. Once E4D 
receives the current state, the state variables are transformed into bulk 
conductivity with a user specified petrophysical function, and interpolated
to the E4D mesh. E4D then simulates a user specified ERT survey, while 
PFLOTRAN computes the next time step. This process repeats until the end of
the simulation. 

The petrophyscal transform currently implemented is a simple differential
form of Archie's Law, which computes the change in bulk conductivity from
the change in saturation and tracer concentration from some baseline
condition. The code is written to enable users to modify the transform for
their own needs, as described in the forthcoming sections.

E4D and PFLOTRAN run on different computational meshes. Users must construct
the unstructured E4D mesh outside of PFLOTRAN, and supply the mesh files as
input. To accomplish this, it is recommend that users be familiar with E4D,
and use mode 1 to build the E4D mesh, as described in the E4D manual locate
at https://e4d.pnnl.gov . Users should also be familiar with E4D's mode 2
and corresponding files for forward modeling. 

The remainder of this document describes the input required to run the E4D
module with PFLOTRAN. 

INPUT FILES

e4d.inp 
The file e4d.inp is the main input file for the E4d module. E4D reads e4d.inp 
to identify the remaining files necessary to run E4D.  The e4d.inp file must 
have 4 lines, as follows (note the e4d.inp file for the pflotran module has a 
different format than the e4d.inp file for the standalone, full version of E4D),

mesh_node_filename	this is the name of the mesh node file
base_survey_file        this is the name of the baseline e4d survey file
conductivity_file       this is the name of the baseline conductivity file
list_file     	        this is the name of the survey listing file

mesh node file
The mesh node file is the first file listed in e4d.inp. It is the node file 
created by tetgen when E4D is run in mode 1 (outside of PFLOTRAN). In addition 
to the mesh node file, the mesh element file and the mesh translation file must
be included in the run directory, with the original names, so that the prefix 
matches that of the mesh node file (see E4D mode 1 documentation at 
https://e4d.pnnl.gov ). 

base survey file
The base survey file is the second file listed in e4d.inp. The base survey file
is an E4D survey file, which specifies all of the electrodes used in the 
simulation and all of the measurements simulated. The format of the survey file
is given in the E4D user manual located at  https://e4d.pnnl.gov . Note that 
every electrode position should have a corresponding node location in the E4D 
mesh, just as when using E4D outside of PFLOTRAN.

conductivity file 
The conductivity file is the third file listed is e4d.inp, and specifies the 
baseline bulk conductivity distribution used by E4D. This file is created 
during mesh generation in E4D, or it can be custom created by users. The 
format of the conductivity file is given in the E4D user guide. 

list file
The list file name is specified on the fourth line of e4d.inp. The list file 
tells the E4D module which times E4D survey should be simulated. For each time 
specified, it lists a conductivity file and a survey file. The conductivity file
specified for a given time is used to tell E4D what bulk conductivity values 
should be used for regions that are outside of the PFLOTRAN domain, and 
therefore have no interpolated values from PFLOTRAN. The survey file specified 
at each time is used to provide measurements values, which are repeated in the 
output files, primarily as an aid for joint inversions. Each survey file must 
have the same format and measurement sequence as the baseline survey file. The 
only value that is allowed to be different is the observed V/I and standard 
deviation. 

The list file also specifies parameters used in the petrophysical transform. 
The format of the list file is as follows:

NT	FF	FC_sw		FC_gw
t1	surv_1	cond_1
t2	surv_2	cond_2
.
.
.
tNT	surv_NT	cond_NT


where:
NT = number of times to simulate ERT surveys
FF = Formation Factor (used in the petro. transform)
FC_sw = surface water fluid conductivity (used in the petro. transform)
FC-gw = groundwater fluid conductivity (used in the current petro. transform)
tx = time x to compute ERT survey(must be specified exactly in PFLOTRAN time)
surv_x = survey file for time x.
cond_x = conductivity file for time x. 

Regions of the ERT domain that are outside of the PFLOTRAN domain will assume 
the values specified in this file at time x. 

Note the the conductivity and survey files specified in the list file need not 
be unique. The same file(s) may be specified for more than one, or all, times. 
This is the most common use. 

pf_mesh.txt
In order to interpolate PFLOTRAN states to the E4D mesh, E4D must know the 
PFLOTRAN mesh dimensions. PFLOTRAN currently does not provide it's mesh 
dimensions to E4D, so they must be specified in an input file. The input file 
where the PFLOTRAN mesh dimensions are provided is pf_mesh.txt. The format of 
pf_mesh is as follows:

ncx
nx_1	nx_2	‘¡­ nx_ncx+1

ncy
ny_1	ny_2 ‘¡­ ny_ncy+1

ncz
nz_1	nz_2 ‘¡­ nz_ncz+1


where:

ncx is the number of cells in the x dimension
nx_* is the *th node position in the x direction. Note there are ncx+1 node 
postions for ncx cells. 

The blocks starting with ncy and ncz are analogous to the ncx block specified 
above. 

OUTPUT FILES
conductivity files
E4D writes a simulated bulk conductivity file for each time step specified in 
the list file. The format of the conductivity file is that same as in the full 
version of E4D. The name of the file is each time step is sigma_Rx*.txt, where 
x is the realization number, and  * is the time stamp specified in the list 
file. 

simulated and observed data file
E4D writes to the simulated and observed ERT measurements to file for each 
time step specified in the list file. For each time step, the file name is 
E4D_x*.txt, where x is the realization number and * is the time stamp specified
in the list file. 



CALLING SEQUENCE
The plflotran input file have the SIMULATION_TYPE HYDROGEOPHYSICS flag. See 
pflotran documentation for details. The command line sequence to run PFLOTRAN 
with the E4D module is:

mpirun -n TP pflotran -pflotranin PFIN < -stochastic > < -num_realizations NR >
< -num_groups NG> -num_slave NS

where:
TP = total number of process (i.e. compute cores) to use
PFIN = pflotran input file name
NR = number of realizations to generate in stochastic mode
NG = number of execution groups to use when running in stochastic mode
NS = number of E4D slaves processes to use. In total, E4D will use NS+1 
processes, one for the master process and NS slave processes. NS should not 
exceed the number of electrodes specified in the electrode block of the survey 
file, or else E4D will terminate.  

0ptions in <> are only used in stochastic mode.  If stochastic mode is used, 
the number of processes allocated to E4D is NG*(NS+1). The remainder of the 
processes are allocated to PFLOTRAN, with (TP-NG(NS+1))/NG processes per group. 


PETROPHYSICAL AND MESH INTERPOLATION SUBROUTINE
The petrophysical transformation and mesh interpolation routine is found in 
the subroutine map_pf_e4d, which is located in e4d_run.F90 .  The mapping from 
the PFLOTRAN grid to the E4D mesh is provided in this subroutine by a number of
integration steps, allowing the mapping and transformation to be execute through
a summation. The matrix map_inds is an integer matrix with two columns and nmap
rows. The vector map is a column vector of floating point values with nmap rows
The first row of  map_inds indexes the PFLOTRAN grid, and the second row indexes
the E4D mesh. The  map holds the integration weights for each of the nmap
elements in the summation. 

For example, assume the petrophysical transform is given by Archies law, where

BC = (1/FF) * FC+S^m

where the formation factor is user provided, FC is the fluid conductivity, S is
the saturation, and m is the saturation exponent. FC and S are provided by 
PFLOTRAN. Let the vector sigma be the vector that holds the bulk conductivity 
in E4D. Let PF_SAT and PF_FC be the PFLOTRAN vectors holding the saturation and 
the fluid conductivity, respectively. Then the bulk conductivity according to 
Archies law is computed by
 
!map PF to E4D

sigma = 0;
for i=1, nmap
       sigma(map_inds(i,1)) = sigma(map_inds(i,1) + map(i)*
       ((1/FF)*PF_FC(map_inds(i,2))*PF_SAT(map_inds(i,2))^m)
end;

!set elements not mapped to baseline conductivity
for i=1,nelem
     if(sigma(i)==0) then
 	sigma(i) = base_sigma(i)
     end if
end;


The mapping vectors can be used implement other petrophysical transforms as 
desired by the users.
